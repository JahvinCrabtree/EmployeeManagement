## Project Aims

The aim of this project was to build another larger project, with a database implementation that was more of a full application that could be used in the real world. As well as pushing myself at problem solving and working through a larger project bit by bit.

- Data manipulation with MySQL alongside Java.
- General Java practice. 

## What is the project?

The project allows the user (the admin) to sign in and view the employees in the (imaginary) business. After accessing the application the user is greeted with a landing page that displays the number of employees, alongside a graph that displays employee data (in the process of fixing this issue) the user can then switch between pages to maniuplate the data that's stored on a local MySQL database.

As shown the data is inputted into the app and shows up ontop the table view - this uipdated the SQL database too. Then moving into the salary tab you're able to manipulate the salary data the same way.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
